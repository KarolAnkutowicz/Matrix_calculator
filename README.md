# Matrix_calculator

The program allows you to perform operations on matrices and vectors as well as basic operations on real numbers. 

You can calculate/designate:
- add*, subtract*, multiply, calculate the power* of matrices;
- multiply matrix and real number;
- cross product*, dot product* and length for vectors;
- determinant** and inverse matrix**;
- transpose matrix;
- add, subtract, multiply, divide*, calculate the power* of real numbers.

* arguments must meet additional conditions ;
** the program enables calculations for specific cases (the size of the matrix and its properties decide).

Additionally:
- basic response mechanisms to erroneous arguments. 

In the future...:
- extension of currently limited functionalities;
- Enabling calculations to be performed on other types of data (e.g. complex numbers).
